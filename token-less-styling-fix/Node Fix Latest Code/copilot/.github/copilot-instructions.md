# Copilot instructions

This repository is built by an agent team. Conventions for ALL code — human or agent — are in
`AGENTS.md` at the repo root (and `PROJECT.md`, which overrides it for existing projects).

- To run the team: open Chat, pick **orchestrator** in the Agent dropdown, and describe the job
  (see PLAYBOOK.md for the five modes).
- Manual mode (SENIOR-WORKFLOW.md): pick **pack-builder** / **pack-tester** for context packs and any team agent by
  name for planning — the built-in Agent mode has none of the team's hooks.
- Outside the team (plain chat), still follow AGENTS.md: FSD import rules, RTK Query only for server
  data, semantic Tailwind tokens, RED-first tests, and never commit to the base branch.
