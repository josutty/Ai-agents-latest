# Audit Trail

Every **public command** completing or escalating must persist:

`artifacts/audit/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<command>-<task>.md`

The orchestrator writes `artifacts/audit/<YYYY-MM-DD>-orchestrator-agent-<command>.md`. Primary agents write their own audit when they run outside a parent command. **Subagents** return structured IO + confidence to the parent; they do not write a second audit unless the parent command names them as the audit owner (`audit-trail-writer`).

Required sections: What, Why, How, Validation, Open Items, Next command.

User-facing completion:

```
✅ /<command> complete.
**Next command:** /<next>
```

No secrets/PHI in audits.

Only `harness-updater` writes `docs/harness/progress.md` and `docs/harness/decisions.md`. Decisions are **append-only**.

## Phase-changing commands (must call harness-updater)

Intake: `/generate-brd` 
Plan: `/plan-sprint` 
Execute: `/implement-api`, `/implement-ui`, `/expand-test-coverage`, `/run-tests`, `/run-eval`, `/close-eval-gaps`, `/review-changes`, `/application-summary`

Satellites (audit only, no harness row): `/propose-architecture`, `/generate-ui-design`

All other commands still require an audit path in DoD.
